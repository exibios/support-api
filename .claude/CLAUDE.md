# support-api — Claude Code conventions

## Architecture

Three layers with distinct responsibilities:

- `app/routes/` — Flask route handlers. Validate input, call a service, return a response.
- `app/services/` — Business logic. All decision-making lives here.
- `app/models/` — SQLAlchemy models. Data structure only, no logic.

Routes call services. Services call models. Routes never query the database directly.
Models never contain business logic. When you see either boundary crossed, flag it.

## Python

- Type hints on all function signatures — parameters and return types both.
- Raise `AppError` from `app/errors.py` for application errors, not bare exceptions.
- Use `async def` for route handlers and any service functions that do I/O.

## Testing

Tests live in `tests/` mirroring the app structure. `app/routes/customers.py` is
tested in `tests/routes/test_customers.py`. Framework is pytest — no unittest patterns.

Before writing tests for any module, read the existing test file first. Don't suggest
scenarios already covered.

## Code review

Flag: database queries in route handlers, business logic in models, bare
`except Exception` blocks, missing type hints on exported functions.

Don't flag: variable naming preferences, docstring style, formatting that
black handles automatically.
